Its a Match Making app where I have used SwiftData for persistence storage and fetched provided rest Api endpoints to fetch potential candidate detail.

Constants: Enum for all the static string
ViewModel: For network call
Model: Struct model to fetch data
SwiftDataModel: To Store the required data from Model into SwiftData for persistence loading
ProfileView: MainView where all tab sections are present
CardView: For userimage handling through Async image
UserInfoView: It handles all the functionality UI like action buttons, breif desc, Long desc
