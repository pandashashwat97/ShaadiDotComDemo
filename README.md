Its a Match Making app where I have used SwiftData for persistence storage and fetched provided rest Api endpoints to fetch potential candidate detail.

1. Constants: Enum for all the static string
2. ViewModel: For network call
3. Model: Struct model to fetch data
4. SwiftDataModel: To Store the required data from Model into SwiftData for persistence loading
5. ProfileView: MainView where all tab sections are present
6. CardView: For userimage handling through Async image
7. UserInfoView: It handles all the functionality UI like action buttons, breif desc, Long desc
